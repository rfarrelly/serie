# SERIE - Soccer Stats Past and Present

## Generate week-by-week stats to track team progression

Football stats websites often don't provide metrics for previous weeks.
This project let's you scrape data from fbref.com and generate plots showing
how metrics like points-per-game (PPG), relative-perfoormance-index (RPI) etc 
change over time.
